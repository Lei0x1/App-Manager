# ðŸ§ª Testing Documentation

To ensure the quality and reliability of the App Manager, follow these guidelines for testing:

## 1. Testing Strategy
 - **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for individual components to verify their functionality. Use a testing framework like Google Test.
 - **Integration Testing**: Test the interaction between different modules to ensure they work together as expected.
 - **Manual Testing**: Perform manual tests for user interface components and overall user experience.

## 2. Writing Tests
 - **Test Structure**: Organize tests in a similar structure to the application code. Each test file should correspond to a module.
 - **Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive names for test cases (e.g., `testCalculateSum_ReturnsCorrectResult`).
 - **Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical parts of the application.

## 3. Running Tests
 - **Automated Testing**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline to run tests automatically on every commit and pull request.
 - **Manual Testing**: Document manual testing steps for non-automated tests, including expected outcomes.

## 4. Reporting Issues
 - **Issue Tracking**: Log any bugs or issues discovered during testing on the projectâ€™s GitHub Issues page.
 - **Bug Reporting Format**: When reporting a bug, include the following:
   - Description of the issue
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected behavior
   - Actual behavior
